# Alcohol Consumption Analysis by Continent

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of global alcohol consumption patterns based on continent using Python and the Pandas library. The dataset is sourced from [this reliable data repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justmarkham/DAT8/master/data/drinks.csv), containing detailed information about alcohol consumption across diverse countries and continents.

## Project Overview

This repository contains Python code for conducting a rigorous analysis of alcohol consumption by continent, leveraging the advanced GroupBy functionality provided by the Pandas library. The analysis comprises loading the dataset, strategically grouping the data by continent, and deriving insightful statistics related to various types of alcohol consumption.

## Analysis Steps

1. Import essential libraries, including Pandas and NumPy.
2. Import the global alcohol consumption dataset from a trusted source.
3. Assign the dataset to a variable named `drinks`.
4. Determine the continent with the highest average beer consumption.
5. Generate detailed statistics regarding wine consumption for each continent.
6. Compute the mean alcohol consumption per continent across all available columns.
7. Calculate the median alcohol consumption per continent across all available columns.
8. Assemble a professional DataFrame presenting the mean, minimum, and maximum spirit consumption values for each continent.
